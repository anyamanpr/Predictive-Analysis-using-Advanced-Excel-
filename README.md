# Predictive-Analysis-using-Advanced-Excel-Project-1
## Business Statistics and Analysis of Housing Development Data using Advanced Excel Tools
### Conducted by Rice University
- Led a predictive analytics project focused on forecasting future housing prices by analyzing historical housing development data.
- Utilized Excel Power Tools including PivotTables, PowerPivot, and Data Analysis Toolpak for data summarization, visualization, and exploration of trends.
- Applied key statistical measures: Mean, Median, Standard Deviation to examine data distribution and detect variability patterns.
- Performed Correlation Analysis to identify interdependencies between variables (e.g., area, number of rooms, locality) as a precursor to Regression Modeling.
- Built and tested Linear and Logarithmic Regression Models to project housing prices. Models were validated using P-values, adjusted RÂ² values for significance and finally Mean Absolute Deviation to assess the model fit and predictive accuracy.
